  <p>
    During my course at Coding Temple Chicago, one of our tasks was to use a
    Ceaser Cypher to encrypt the text within an existing webpage, then create a
    single page to display that text with a display toggle to encrypt/decrypt.
  </p>
  <p>
    My team of three divided the work. I primarily focused on the HTML and CSS,
    while my other teammate worked on the Python for encoding and scraping the
    text and the other wrote some JavaScript to toggle the display of the page's
    content
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I was finished with the webpage itself, I worked with my teammates to
    help them finish their tasks, then merged all the work together on GitHub.
