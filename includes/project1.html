  <p>While working at the College of Arts & Sciences - IT (CAS-IT), I was tasked with developing a new website for the Math department.
    </p>
    <p> Using a base template our team built for new websites, I was able to transfer all necessary existing content and implement new changes to the site's layout and organization. Another student from the Math department was responsible for supplying me with the proper content and giving insight to the design and presentation.</p>
