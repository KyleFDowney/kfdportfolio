  <p>
    One of our first tasks at Coding Temple Chicago was to recreate the Periodic
    Table of Elements using only HTML and CSS. Due to its unique shape, this
    proved challenging until I was able to figure out an acceptable layout using
    multiple tables. It was important that the page could be read without
    zooming in, however the text is quite small due to the density of
    information on the table.
  </p>
  <p>
    The page scales quite well in mobile views, however the text is impossibly
    small to read without pinch-zooming.
