  <h3 class="my-3 mobile-centered">Periodic Table - HTML</h3>
  <p>One of our first tasks at Coding Temple Chicago was to recreate the Periodic Table of Elements using only HTML and CSS. Due to its uinque shape, this proved challenging until I was able to figure out an acceptable layout using multiple tables. It was important that the page could be read without zooming in, however the text is quite small due to the density of information on the table.</p>
  <p>The page scales quite well in mobile views, however the text is impossibly small to read without pinch-zooming.</p>
